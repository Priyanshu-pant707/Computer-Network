# Transmission Delay 

- it is  the amount of delay for transmitter to place frames on media.
  - ***B*** : medium bandwidth in bps.
  - ***L*** : bits in frame/packet.

```
  T=L/b sec.
```


### Transmission Delay depends upon the Following factors
- if there are multiple active sessions,the delay will become significant.
- increasing bandwidth decreases transmission delay.
- MAC protocol largely influences the delay is the link is shared  among multiple devices.
- sending and receiving a packet involves a context switch in the operating system, which takes a finite time.
