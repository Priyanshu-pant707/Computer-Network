# Propagation Delay 
- time taken by the last bit of the packet to reach from source to the destination is called propagation delay.

## Factor affecting pd:
1. Distance - it takes more time to reach the destination if the distance of the medium is longer.
2. Velocity - if the velocity of the medium is higher , the packet will br received faster.

```
T= Distance / Velocity
