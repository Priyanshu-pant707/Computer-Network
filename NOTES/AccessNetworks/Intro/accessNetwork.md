# Access Network

---

- An access nnetwork is  the part of a communication network that connects end devices(like computer,phones,Iot devices ,etc).
- Also called the `edge router` or `default gateway`.
- It acts as the entry  point for users into a larger network(like the internet).
- Access networks are means by which internet service providers (ISPs) provide internet connectivity to their customers. They are final part of infrastructure that connects end-users to internet. Access networks can be wired or wireless and have different characteristics that make them suitable for different applications.
- Wired access networks use cables such as copper wires or fiber optics that run through the ground or along power lines, while wireless access networks use radio waves or microwaves. Hybrid access networks combine both wired and wireless technologies for increased reliability and speed.

- Access networks are an essential part of internet infrastructure. They provide means by which end-users connect to internet and access online services. Access networks can be wired or wireless and have different characteristics that make them suitable for different applications. Coaxial and fiber optic access networks are wired networks that provide high-speed internet access. Cellular and Wi-Fi access networks are wireless networks that provide internet access over a wide or limited area, respectively. Understanding characteristics of different access networks is essential for selecting right network for your application.
