# Wireless Access Networks

- provide internet connectivity without cables or wires.

- they are widely adopted because they:
 1. Require less infrastructure compared to wired networks.
 2. can be installed and maintained easily.
 3. offer coverage acroos diverse locations and environments.

 ## Main  types of wireless access networks:
 1. wi-fi (wireless fidelity)
  - Most common type of wireless network.
  - used in LANs at homes,offices,and public places like airports ,libraries and coffee shops.
  - operates via wireless access points(APs) that transmit data using radio frequencies(2.4 GHz,5GHz,6GHz bands)
  - range: typically 30-100 meters in indoors.
  Example uses: Browsing ,online meetings,file sharing.

2. Cellular Networks (Mobile Networks)
- use cell towers(base stations) to provide wide area coverage.
- enable seamless mobility (users can move while staying connected).
- standards: 3G ,4G lite and 5G (high speed and low latency).
- often used in areas where wired networks are impractical.
- Example users : Voice calls,SMS,mobile internet, video streaming.

3. Satellite Networks
 - Provide connectivity via satellites orbiting the Earth.

 - Cover large and remote geographic areas where terrestrial networks are unavailable.

 - Advantages: High reliability and global coverage.

 - Limitations: Expensive, higher latency (especially with geostationary satellites).

 - Example uses: Aviation, maritime communication, disaster recovery, remote rural internet.
