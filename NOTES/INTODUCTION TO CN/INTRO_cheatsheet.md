# 💻 Computer Networks - Summary Notes

## 🌐 What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that can share data and resources.

## 📚 Types of Networks
| Type       | Description                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| PAN        | Personal Area Network (e.g. Bluetooth)   |
| LAN        | Local Area Network (within a building)   |
| MAN        | Metropolitan Area Network (city-wide)    |
| WAN        | Wide Area Network (country/worldwide)    |
| WLAN       | Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi)                     |

## 🧱 Network Topologies
- **Bus**: Single backbone cable.
- **Star**: All nodes connected to central hub.
- **Ring**: Each node connected to two others forming a loop.
- **Mesh**: Every node connected to every other node.
- **Hybrid**: Combination of two or more topologies.

---

## ⚙️ Network Devices
- **Router**: Connects different networks.
- **Switch**: Connects devices in a LAN.
- **Hub**: Broadcasts data to all ports (less efficient).
- **Modem**: Converts digital to analog signals.
- **Repeater**: Regenerates weak signals.

---

## 🛠️ OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. **Application** - Interfaces with the end user.
2. **Presentation** - Translates, encrypts, compresses data.
3. **Session** - Maintains sessions between users.
4. **Transport** - Ensures reliable data (TCP/UDP).
5. **Network** - Routing of data (IP).
6. **Data Link** - Error detection and MAC addressing.
7. **Physical** - Raw bit transmission over media.

## 🌍 Internet Protocols
| Protocol | Purpose                            |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| HTTP/HTTPS | Web communication                 |
| FTP       | File transfer                      |
| SMTP      | Sending emails                     |
| POP3/IMAP | Receiving emails                   |
| DNS       | Converts domain names to IP        |
| DHCP      | Assigns IP addresses dynamically   |

---

## 🛰️ IP Addressing
- **IPv4**: 32-bit (e.g. 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit (e.g. 2001:0db8::1)
- **Private IP**: Used within networks (e.g. 192.168.x.x)
- **Public IP**: Globally unique on the internet

---

## 🔐 Network Security
- **Firewall**: Filters incoming/outgoing traffic.
- **Encryption**: Secures data.
- **VPN**: Creates secure connection over internet.
- **Antivirus**: Protects against malware.

---

## 📶 Transmission Modes
- **Simplex**: One-way communication
- **Half-Duplex**: One direction at a time
- **Full-Duplex**: Both directions simultaneously

---

## 📥 Switching Techniques
- **Circuit Switching**: Dedicated path (e.g. telephone)
- **Packet Switching**: Data broken into packets (e.g. internet)
- **Message Switching**: Whole message sent and stored temporarily

---

## 📈 Important Terms
- **Bandwidth**: Data transfer capacity
- **Latency**: Time taken to send data
- **Throughput**: Actual data transferred
- **Jitter**: Variation in delay

---

> 📌 **Tip:** Focus on OSI layers, protocols, IP addressing, and devices for most exams and interviews!
